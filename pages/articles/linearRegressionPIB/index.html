                The data was extracted using the <b>API provided by INEGI</b>, specifically from the Indicators Bank under <b>"GDP and National Accounts"</b>, focusing on the <b>"Quarterly Gross Domestic Product by Economic Activity (in millions of pesos at 2013 prices)"</b> for the Mexican economy, covering data from the first quarter of 1993 to the first quarter of 2023.

                However, to align with the objective of estimating the national GDP while considering current economic relationships, it was necessary to narrow the time frame to capture more recent patterns and trends. Recognizing potential structural and economic shifts over the last three decades, the dataset was refined to include data from the second quarter of 2008 onwards, encompassing the last 15 years up to the most recent available period (first quarter of 2023). This selection of 60 quarters enables the model to better reflect the current interactions between economic activities and GDP, minimizing the influence of past economic events and policies that may no longer be relevant.

            <p class="small-text">
                In the development process of our multiple regression model, it is crucial to assess multicollinearity between the independent variables, as its presence can affect the stability of the coefficients and the interpretation of the results. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other, which can hinder the accurate estimation of each variable's individual effects on the dependent variable.
            </p>
            
            <p class="small-text">
                To detect and address multicollinearity, we use the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), a statistical tool that measures how much the variances of the coefficients are inflated due to the correlation between the independent variables. A VIF value greater than or equal to 10 is generally considered indicative of significant multicollinearity.
            </p>
            
            <p class="small-text">
                The procedure followed in this analysis is as follows: we calculate the VIFs for all variables and, if the VIF of one or more variables is greater than or equal to 10, we remove the variable with the highest VIF from the model. We then recalculate the VIFs for the remaining variables and repeat this elimination process until all VIFs are below 10. This approach ensures that the variables in the model are sufficiently independent from each other, improving the stability and accuracy of the regression model.

                Although we have eliminated multicollinearity in our model, this does not guarantee that all the remaining variables are suitable for inclusion in the final model. The next step is to select the linear regression model with the best performance. If there are two or more models with nearly identical performance, the one with the smallest standard deviation will be chosen, as this indicates greater stability in predictions.

            <p class="small-text text-white">
                The performance of a linear regression model is evaluated using the adjusted R-squared (R² adjusted), which takes into account both the goodness of fit and the number of independent variables, penalizing the inclusion of variables that do not add value to the model.

            <p class="small-text text-white mb-5">
                Before selecting the optimal model, we present the results table showing the two best models for each number of independent variables, starting from the model with 1 independent variable up to the model with all the variables. This table contains the adjusted R-squared (R² adjusted) and the standard deviation of each model, allowing for a comparison between different variable configurations.

                At this point, we will analyze the constant of the model to determine if it is appropriate to force the model to pass through the origin. The decision depends on whether the confidence interval of the constant includes zero; if so, it might be considered to eliminate the constant and perform a regression without an intercept.

            <div class="mb-3">
                The confidence intervals of the constant are: -9837427.2603 < b<sub>0</sub> < 3510693.9333, so 0 is part of the interval. This suggests a possible regression through the origin. However, given the context of the model and the nature of the national GDP, we will not remove the constant. It is important to consider that although the variables in the model explain a large proportion of the GDP, they do not represent all the factors influencing the national economy. Assigning a value of zero to the GDP when all explanatory variables are zero would not be realistic, as it implies there are no other economic factors at play.

                <p>
                    It is essential to ensure that the model's residuals are normally distributed and have a mean close to zero. There are two approaches to verify this assumption: the graphical method and the analytical method. In this project, we will use both approaches to have both a visual and statistical confirmation of the normality of the residuals.

                <p>
                    For the graphical validation, we will use the QQ plot (quantile-quantile plot) and a histogram of the residuals. In the QQ plot, the "x" axis represents the theoretical quantiles of a normal distribution, while the "y" axis shows the observed quantiles of the residuals. A trend line is superimposed on the plot to help us visualize the spread of the points: the closer the points are to the line, the more normal the distribution of the residuals will be. Additionally, a histogram of the residuals allows us to assess the shape of their distribution and verify that it is centered around zero.

                <p>
                    Complementarily, we applied the Chi-square normality test. This statistical test allows us to verify whether the distribution of the residuals significantly deviates from a normal distribution. The null hypothesis of this test states that the residuals follow a normal distribution with a mean of 0, while the alternative hypothesis indicates otherwise.

                    Our Chi-square test results were: 4.8779 < 11.0705. These results show that there is not enough evidence to reject the hypothesis of normality with a mean of 0 for the residuals. This analytically confirms that the residuals come from a normal distribution with a mean of zero, thereby validating one of the key assumptions for the model's reliability.

                <p>
                    A second crucial assumption in linear regression is the constant variance of residuals, also known as homoscedasticity. This means that the variability of errors should be constant across all prediction values. If this assumption is not met (heteroscedasticity), it may indicate that the model struggles to fit certain regions of the data, which would affect the accuracy and validity of predictions.

                <p>
                    To assess this assumption, we use the Versus Fit Plot, a scatter plot where the "x" axis represents the model’s estimated responses, and the "y" axis shows the residuals. If the points on this graph are randomly scattered and show no clear pattern or trend, we can assume that the variance of residuals is constant. On the other hand, if the points exhibit a specific shape or pattern (e.g., a fan or cone shape), this would indicate heteroscedasticity.

                <p>
                    <br>Upon observing the Versus Fit Plot, we note that the points are uniformly distributed around the horizontal axis without a discernible pattern. This indicates that the residuals have constant variance across all estimates of our model, confirming that the homoscedasticity assumption holds.

            </div>
            
            <p>
                For a linear regression model to be valid, the errors or residuals must be independent of each other. This means that the value of one error should not depend on the value of previous errors; in other words, the errors must be uncorrelated. If correlation is present, the model may be leaving unexplained patterns, which could affect the accuracy of its predictions.

            </div>
            
            <p>
                One way to validate the uncorrelation of errors is through the Versus Order Plot. In this graph, the "x" axis represents the position of each observation in temporal order (1, 2, ..., n), and the "y" axis shows the value of the residuals. This graph helps identify whether the errors follow any pattern based on time or observation order. If no clear pattern or trend is observed in the dispersion of points, we can assume that the errors are uncorrelated.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br>Upon observing the Versus Order Plot, we note that no discernible pattern or obvious trend is present in the residuals over time, which suggests that the errors are uncorrelated. For this reason, we conclude that the assumption of uncorrelated errors is met based on the graphical analysis.

            <p>
                To complement the validation of this assumption, we used the Durbin-Watson test, which is a statistical test that detects the presence of first-order autocorrelation in the errors of a regression model. This test is useful in contexts where errors are recorded at regular time intervals and can confirm whether there is correlation between consecutive errors.

            <p>
                <br>In this case, the results of the Durbin-Watson test were inconclusive, so we relied on the visual analysis obtained from the Versus Order Plot. Since the graph does not show any pattern of correlation, we conclude that the assumption of uncorrelated errors holds.

            <p>
                Identifying outliers is crucial in regression analysis, as they can negatively influence the fit and accuracy of the model. To address this issue, we applied a standardized residual method, which allows us to assess if any observation deviates significantly from the general pattern of the data.

            <p>
                The standardized residual method involves calculating an adjusted residual for each observation, taking into account its influence on the model. In this way, we can detect unusual observations. In this analysis, an observation is considered an outlier if its absolute standardized residual exceeds a value of 3.

                Model Conclusion

            <p>
                After conducting a thorough analysis of our regression model, we evaluated and verified each of the fundamental assumptions: normality of residuals, constant variance, independence of errors, and absence of outliers. Each of these steps contributed to confirming that our model meets the necessary statistical requirements to be considered robust and reliable.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The absence of patterns or trends in the residuals and the confirmation of constant variance indicate that the model consistently captures the relationship between the variables. Additionally, the verification of uncorrelated errors and the lack of outlier observations reinforce that the model is not distorted by external or unusual influences in the data.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Taken together, these results validate that our model is statistically solid and suitable for making reliable predictions, offering a high degree of accuracy and performance in its practical application.
